Basic flow of knitout to smobj translation:

Maintain:
 - height of each column of stitches (per needle location per bed)
 - face/edge index at the top of each column
 - locations of all inter-bed crossings
 - parking locations for each yarn carrier

Per instruction --
  (1a) if yarn not in, yarn appears on carrier track at stitch-aligned location
  (1b) if yarn is in, line is made from old location to stitch-aligned location
  (2) line is made from carrier track to stitch edge
  (3) stitch face is made
  (4) line is made from stitch edge to carrier track
  (5) whole assembly is hoisted as needed to avoid collisions

-----

TODO:
 - Implement "miss" instruction.
 - Move carrier when parked adjacent to back stitch and kickbacks require such a motion. (E.g., when stitch is made then bed is racked.)
 - Check: does leading carrier end up on the front or the back when pulling a loop to the back during plating? (Currently, face library assumes it ends up to the back.)
 - Consider making yarn travel faces shorter somehow.
